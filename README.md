# Give me the F-ing PDF

![annoying frames](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/gmtfPDF/master/image.png)

Countless journal sites have adopted the same terrible web design, requiring an
extra click to get a PDF of an article.
[Nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFEoMO0pc7k) has time for that. This
is a simple fix: a Google Chrome Extension that modifies the links to the PDFs
such that they won't open up with frames.

This works with journals such as:

 - PNAS
 - Molecular Biology and Evolution
 - Wiley

and many others! You can install the Google Chrome Extension directly from [the
Google Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/give-me-the-f-ing-pdf/iekjpaipocoglamgpjoehfdemffdmami).
